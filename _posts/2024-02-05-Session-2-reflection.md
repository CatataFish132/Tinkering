# Materials
The session started with a small presentation talking about materials. Shortly after we went to actually explore different materials. We had to think about what makes a material tinkerable. My thoughts on this are written in this [post](/posts/Tinkering-Materials).

# My mindset
I have a practical mindset, I rather get started right away doing stuff than overthinking everything. I feel like this is quite helpful for tinkering. The only problem with it was that I wanted to quickly to begin doing things and I hadn't fully grasped what we were making. I had an idea for myself but everyone had their own idea from the concept we were going to make. The coordination in the group was also a bit of a mess but that was expected. It would have been great if we first got together and came up with ideas and visualized those on paper perhaps to communicate to the other group members and then we could have started making it. Instead it was a bit of a mess with people doing stuff and no one seeing the bigger picture. But in the end it worked out fine and we made something. Maybe the chaos is part of tinkering with a group, I usually tinker by myself so I am not used to not knowing what the end goal even is.

# Materials
we used:
- cardboard
- servo motors
- hot glue
- metal wires
- Googly eyes (very important)
- Popsicle sticks


these materials except for the servo motors aren't precious at all so we didn't mind bending, folding or cutting them. They are inexpensive and easy to use so great for tinkering.
Cardboard was the first thing we grabbed, this was because it's very easy to use and also the main building material we used, the other were extra's to connect other cardboard pieces together and make them move. The servo motor's were the ones with the highest ceiling even though it wasn't very high. It made it possible for it to actually move but were still very easy to use with the controllers provided.

# Instructions
We didn't get many instructions, we were showed how the screw was used for connecting cardboard together and we had to make something with the servo motors using the materials and tools provided. This gave us a lot of freedom which is fine but I wished we had gotten more restrictions because that would allow us to be more creative.

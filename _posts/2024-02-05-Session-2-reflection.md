The session started with a small presentation talking about materials. Shortly after we went to actually explore different materials. We had to think about what makes a material tinkerable. My thoughts on this are written in this [post](/Tinkering-Materials).

# My mindset
I have a practical mindset, I rather get started right away doing stuff than overthinking everything. I feel like this is quite helpful for tinkering.
%% - Sit down after the session and review your notes and share materials and insights. If still fresh, work out some of the notes you took into a bit more detail if necessary.
    
- Now also take a moment to consider your own thinking during the session. You may like or dislike the concept of mindset but it is a valuable concept to reflect on how your mind is tackling things (or how it is geared up to do a task). Do you recognize aspects of thinking that could be helpful or not helpful for tinkering? Quickly sum up your thoughts and findings and discuss them with the others
    
- describe the materials quickly experienced in the first session. What makes them suitable?
    
- which of the experienced tools and materials has the lowest threshold? i.e which materials are easiest to get started with (are grabbed right away, no thinking, no consideration)
    
- which of the experienced tools and materials has the highest ceiling? I.e, with which materials could you come closest to applications in the real world?
    
- To which extent does the **exact** instruction play a role? Do you need an introduction in the materials(seed) or towards the goal (discovery) or the tooling/skills?
    
- Can you recognize most of the aspects of the framework in action? %%


We had to make a thing with 3 servos and some other supplies like cardboard and sticks.
It was a group assignment and it was quite chaotic. We started with coming up with ideas and we went for a head-scratcher. After we all agreed we started right away, there were some cutting cardboard and I was mostly looking for ways to attach everything together with the servo's. Everything went quite smoothly even though it was quite chaotic and I had a completely different idea in mind of a head-scratcher than we ended up making. It was very fun to use the materials and a great way to get started with cardboard. I wish we all agreed on a design beforehand to make everything more clear, this could be done using some quick sketches. Like what I had in mind was a person scratching their own head but what others had in mind was a hand that could scratch your head. But this was made clear to me after we were halfway done.

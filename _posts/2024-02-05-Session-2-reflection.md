We had to make a thing with 3 servos and some other supplies like cardboard and sticks.
It was a group assignment and it was quite chaotic. We started with coming up with ideas and we went for a head-scratcher. After we all agreed we started right away, there were some cutting cardboard and I was mostly looking for ways to attach everything together with the servo's. Everything went quite smoothly even though it was quite chaotic and I had a completely different idea in mind of a head-scratcher than we ended up making. It was very fun to use the materials and a great way to get started with cardboard. I wish we all agreed on a design beforehand to make everything more clear, this could be done using some quick sketches. Like what I had in mind was a person scratching their own head but what others had in mind was a hand that could scratch your head. But this was made clear to me after we were halfway done.

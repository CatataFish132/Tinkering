# Materials
The session started with a small presentation talking about materials. Shortly after we went to actually explore different materials. We had to think about what makes a material tinkerable. My thoughts on this are written in this [post](/posts/Tinkering-Materials).

# Affordance

Affordance of a material is a concept that was a bit difficult for me to grasp, but I will try to explain it as I have understood it. lets take Lego as an example, Lego has a high affordance because it communicates its function to the user quite well. When you grab a couple of Lego blocks you sort of 'know' what to do with it even if you have never seen it before. This is because the Lego itself communicates its own function to you by its design.

For some examples of bad affordance the teacher's gave an example about the door handles in Cubicus, they have a weird shape so it is quite unclear how to use one when you see it for the first time. But I found another example in the Ravelijn building (I forgot to make pictures). The sinks at the bathroom in the Ravelijn building clearly communicate that you should pull the tap up, the handle is like a flat plane which can easily be pulled up, but it doesn't go up, you have to turn it. The disconnect between the actual usage and the communicated usage makes this sink have bad affordance.

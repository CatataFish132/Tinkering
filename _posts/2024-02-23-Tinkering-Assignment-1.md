When first hearing this assignment my mind directly went to magnets instead of any physical link, 
this might have be the case because in a lot of 3d prints you use magnets when you want to attach something to something else but not permenantly. 
So here is my design, it is a cube and every plane has 4 magnets in the corners, 
the only hurdle in this design is how to place the magnets and in which orientation.
the top and bottom of the blocks should have oposite polarization,
other wise you wouldn't be able to stack them.
I want to arrange the mangets in such a way that it would not be possible to incorrectly connect them.
This is why for the top and bottom all the magnets are either south or north poles,
but for the sides, one has the 2 top magnets north and the 2 bottom magnets south, while the other side has them alternating.
This way it is not possible to line up these blocks incorrectly, side 1 can only connect to side 1, and side 2 can only connect to side 2.

Constructing this block is easy, it is just a regular block with hole drills inside for the magnets to fit in, 
and because it uses magnets it is possible to cover up these magnets without impeding their function.

One advantage of this building block is that it can connect to any side, unlike the popular lego block that only connects the bottom and the top, this block connects to the sides aswell, so it is very versatile.
A disavantage of this building block is that it is not very structurally strong, but this is also depended on the magnets that are used.

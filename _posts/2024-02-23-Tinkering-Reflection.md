- Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?
Let's start with where I think the definition coincide, tinkering to me is trying things that seem plausible, but instead of researching the problem to see if it does actually work you just go ahead and try it.  It is like having an idea that sounds stupid at first but the more you think about the more possible it seems. The way it differs though is that Tinkering itself is more of a creative process as well.It's a way of coming up with new ideas, like you might have had a stupid idea that sounded plausible but you tried it and it failed horribly but through this undertaking you saw something and that might have given you another idea to try, maybe it is something similar but it could also be a completely different approach that just popped into your head. So in short, Tinkering requires trial and error but Tinkering itself is inherently more creative and innovative.

- Can you take a typical EE related project case and list 5 technical hurdles? to which extent do they allow for a 'playful' approach in tackling them?

1. When you get an EE project you usually have a customer with a problem, it is your job to create a solution for this particular problem. Fortunately there are more possible solutions to this problem than just one so you come up with multiple solutions and even try a couple to see if they work as expected.

2. When designing a circuit you can play with different components, this is the most fun when done in real life instead of a simulation but it's also a fire hazard :)

List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?

## Q1: Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?

Let's start with where I think the definition coincide, tinkering to me is trying things that seem plausible, but instead of researching the problem to see if it does actually work you just go ahead and try it.  It is like having an idea that sounds stupid at first but the more you think about the more possible it seems. The way it differs is that Tinkering itself is more of a creative process. It's a way of coming up with new ideas. Like you might have a stupid idea that sounds plausible, you tried it, and it failed horrifically. But through this undertaking you saw something which gave you another idea to try, maybe it is something similar, but it could also be a completely different approach. So in short, Tinkering requires trial and error, but Tinkering itself is inherently more creative and innovative.

## Q2: Can you take a typical EE related project case and list 5 technical hurdles? to which extent do they allow for a 'playful' approach in tackling them?

1. When you get an EE project you usually have a customer with a problem, it is your job to create a solution for this particular problem. Fortunately there are more possible solutions to this problem than just one so you come up with multiple solutions and even try a couple to see if they work as expected.
2. When designing a circuit you can play with different components, this is the most fun when done in real life instead of a simulation, but it's also a fire hazard :)
3. When you design a circuit, it might not work or work sub-optimally.  So you need to find out what the problem is, this doesn't really allow for any playful approach.
4. For EE projects we also do a lot of programming, this can be done playfully because programming is quite idiot-proof, you could just try stuff and see if it works.
5. Lastly, for projects a lot of testing has to be done to verify if the final product has all the requirements. This is quite tedious and you can't really tackle this in a playful way.

## Q3: Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an EE specialist
### Online
I get inspired by either easily used electronic components, which you can find at sites like spark fun, they sell breakout boards, micro-controllers among other stuff. Or by cool projects! so the rest of this list are sources where you can find projects of other people.
1. https://www.sparkfun.com/
2. https://hackaday.io/projects
3. https://www.instructables.com/
4. https://youtube.com/
5. VoidStarLab discord server

### Physical
This list of physical sources of tinkerspiration was a bit more difficult to come up with because I tend to use online sources for inspiration. As mentioned in my previous list I get inspiration from projects and easily used components, so this is a list where you could see cool projects and find components.
1. HackerSpaces/MakerSpaces
2. Electronic Labs
3. Project Showcases
4. Electronic stores
5. Science/Tech museums/hubs

## Q4: List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?

Tinkering thrives in domains where mistakes have little to no consequences, and where components are cheap or re-usable.

1. Design (inexpensive to make designs due to technologies like 3D printing)
2. Electronics (components are cheap and re-usable)
3. Programming (making mistakes has no consequences)
4. Education (special toolboxes are available for educational purposes and tinkering is great for learning things)
5. Robotics (kits are available, iterative, re-usable components)

You shouldn't tinker in domains where mistakes have consequences, where components are very sensitive, and where mishandling components can be dangerous to other's or yourself.

1. Medical industry (You could be endangering other peoples lives)
2. Aerospace engineering (Realizing designs is expensive)
3. Chemistry (You could accidentally make something toxic and endanger yourself and others)
4. Civil engineering (Structures need to be stable, otherwise you endanger people's lives.)
5. Finances (You are gonna lose money investing in the wrong stuff, and that is expensive!!!!)

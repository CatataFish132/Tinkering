This is my workspace, I circled the 3 most things that I think are important when tinkering. 
Next to my laptop you can see a couple of micro controllers which I use a lot for projects, 
I also have some paper and pencils (I really like pencils more than pens) to either draw some stuff or write something down.
Lastly I circled my speakers, when busy tinkering I like to listen to music so I can focus, but not focus too much.
I wish I had more electronics components laying around so I could play with them more and get more physical.
Having a clean workplace might also help with tinkering (I cleaned it specifically for this picture XD).
And lastly I think a standing desk might help with tinkering because you are more active that way (and its also good for your back, so that's also a nice bonus).

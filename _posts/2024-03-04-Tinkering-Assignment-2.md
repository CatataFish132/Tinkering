# Preciousness

For this assignment I had to iterate on my previous design but change the preciousness and also make an interfacing piece that can interface with different materials.
The current design has a quite high preciousness because of the amount of magnets it uses, so the block itself is very precious, but a simpler version of what I wanted the block to achieve can be created using just one magnet on each side.
This means that instead of using 24 magnets we can just use 6 which significantly reduces its preciousness. To further reduce it's preciousness we can make it out of non precious material instead of wood, One idea that came to my mind is to use cardboard like we did in the lecture. Cardboard is cheap and this means you will automatically do more with it.
The final building block could just be a block folded out of cardboard and then with magnets on the inside. If you want to make the block more precious however, it can be made from ABS. It's the same plastic that Lego block uses, the block can be designed to be very strong this way and would be even more precious than Lego blocks because it has magnets. 

# Interoperability

Now the challenge of  making the block interface with different materials,
This can be done by making a special block that is quite thin and has one strong magnet.
With this block you can put a piece of cardboard/cloth or other materials that aren't too thick between it. The force of the magnets will then hold the material, it would already be possible to do this without any special kind of block, like you could make a stick figure and put a cape on it by putting a piece of cloth under its head.

# Affordance

To increase the affordance of this block we can paint the sides so that it is quite clear what side can connect to what other side. The universal red and blue color scheme can be used, and maybe adding a special marking for the top and bottom of the blocks. This will make the block that is already quite intuitive even more intuitive to use.

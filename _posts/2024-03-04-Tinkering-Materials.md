- Tinkerability: How Tinkerable a material is.
- Preciousness: how precious the material is, like Lego is very precious because it is expensive and you would not want to break it or cut it in half.
- Intuitive: how intuitive a material is, can you figure out how to use it without using a manual of some sorts?
- Idiot proof: Idiot proof materials are materials that don't break easily if you handle them incorrectly.
- Modularity: How modular a material is. Like components that can easily be rearranged.
- Customizability: The ability of the material to be customized, an arduino for example is very customizable because you can upload your own code to it, while little bits aren't at all customizable because you are unable to change anything of the components.
- Versatility: how versatile a material is, can it be used for many purposes?
- High ceiling: How complex you can get with a material.
- Wide walls: How many "routes" you can take from the floor to the ceiling of the material.
- Low floor: How easy it is to get started with a material.
- Affordance: The ability of the material to communicate how it is used.
- Re-usability: How reusable the material is.
- Sustainability: how sustainable the material is regarding to environmental.
- Ecological footprint: how much resources are used or waste is generated while producing the material.
- Wastefulness: how much waste is generated by the material or the production of the material
- Responsiveness:

# Session 3 reflection

## Chapter 5

This chapter mostly focuses on constructionism as a way of teaching instead of instructionism. Constructionism can be summed up in these points:
- learn by doing
- hard fun
- learning to learn
- taking time (time management)
- you can't get it right without getting it wrong

I personally really like this idea of learning, it seems to be an overhaul to the mess we currently have of boring lectures, teacher telling you stuff for 2h and then leaving afterwards with only 10% of the information retained. Learning by doing is a great way to learn and it makes it fun too! The chapter also talks about how teacher should take step back and should let the student take more control, this is captured in this quote from Seymour Papert:

>Less us, More them

The book also continues to talk about how teachers are forced to assess students and that this disrupts the learning process. This portion reminds me of a video essay I watched a while back from Zoe Bee called [Grading is a myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe-SZ_FPZew&t=1177s)which extensively goes into why grading students is bad for learning. This is mostly due to the focus becoming the rewards of a passing grade instead of learning itself, so students tend to do the minimal amount of learning necessary for a good grade. Giving a grade also reduces the value of learning, as Zoe Bee puts it (I'm paraphrasing here) `If I gave you a sandwich and told you that i would give 5 bucks if you ate it, then you would think that something is wrong with that sandwich.` So giving a reward after learning is basically saying that learning is so bad that you need a reward otherwise you wouldn't do it.

The assignment question was mostly to see where Montessori and Papert views overlapped or differed but i couldn't find much about Montessori view in this chapter. This was the only quote I could find.

>Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.
 -Maria Montessori

But judging by just this quote, Papert and Montessori definitely agree that kids should learn by doing and not be told what to do step by step but rather learn to figure it out themselves.

## Chapter 9

You don't need a Design/FabLab. You need a place that grabs student attention but also has stuff they can directly play, preferably this should have a low threshold, but also high ceiling and wide walls so that students don't get bored. The space should be gender neutral as to not discourage women to also get started with tinkering. It's good if the space has movable furniture, a lot of electrical outlets, chalk/whiteboard, good lighting, project storage space and is overall functional but also flexible so that students can work in the way they would like.

## Lego Serious Play

> Do adults need a different approach or role in facilitation? Which concepts are relevant?

I think they don't need a different approach in facilitation. The most important things are that the facilitator should help people to explore, learn and develop and not to drive the group towards a certain conclusion or outcome. So they are like a helper, but shouldn't interfere much which is I think the same way kids should facilitated.

# Framing

Our playground session is an introduction to digital electronics using our Logic Blocks. It is meant as an introduction to digital electronics so the main goal is learning. Some of the technical hurdles we encountered were that we have a limited supply of logic blocks and also that we have to consider that not everyone has the same pre-knowledge or even any pre-knowledge of digital electronics at all.

# Materials

The seed of this playground session would be the logic block itself, as it should be new for everyone joining the session.  There are multiple prompts to help get everyone started with using our logic blocks. The only material needed for this playground session would be our Logic Blocks.

# Scaffolding

First an instruction on how the blocks themselves work is given, after that each group will be figuring out what each block does by experimentation and using some of the scaffolding cards provided. More complex blocks like flip flops and multiplexers are given later. Information about each block is given using scaffolding cards when necessary. Prompts are given in increasing difficulty, for example first the basic blocks are experimented with, later flip flops are used to make state machines.

# Session Requirements

**Location**
* This session can be given anywhere.

**Space**
* Tables should be available.
* Tables should be arranged in groups.
* Every table need at-least 1 power outlet.

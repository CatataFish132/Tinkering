# Q1: Tinkering is a way to generate knowledge. What kind of knowledge results from a tinkering process in your experience?
New ideas! Tinkering is about trying out ideas, seeing why they do or don't work and then coming up with new and better ideas. It's also a great way to learn new skills, for the group project I wanted to learn how a processor works so I made the unrealistic goal of trying to make a processor in vhdl. I haven't actually finished it, but I now know how vhdl works, and how a simple processor works. Just because I was tinkering with it. I even made my own processor design. (fun thing is that I actually had to learn vhdl for a course, but i couldn't for the life of me get myself to watch a 2h tutorial video they gave us.)

# Q2: Tinkering with classical materials like clay, paper, colour, textiles, is more related to craft. How does tinkering work with digital and electronic media?

# Q3: One basic characteristic of science is reproducibility. Is that possible with tinkering? Or do we want that at all?
Reproducibility is definitely possible with tinkering, at sites like instructibles there are projects that other have made and you can recreate them. But i don't think it is very important for tinkering. Documenting everything in detail is nice but it takes away from the actual time tinkering. I'm not saying you shouldn't document things at all, i'm just saying that you should keep it simple and it doesn't have to be reproducible. If you finally found something cool that works you can start with actually correctly documenting everything and making it reproducible if you want.

# Q4: Design practice changed during the past years, from long design phases to short, iterative processes, due to the availability of new prototyping technologies. Is this iterative process of prototyping qualitatively different from the cycles we do in tinkering?
No, in tinkering we also use very short iterative processes. You try something, see if it works, see why it didn't or did work, and lastly you try something new.

- Can a co-design session be described as a tinkering session as we treat it in our course?
    
- The choice of materials (seed, tools, scaffolding, facilitation) has an effect on the outcome, the knowledge and products made in a tinkering session. How can we use that in a co-design session? Can we really influence the kind of results here, and do we want that?
    
- In “research through design” can tinkering fill in the design part?
    
- Are there design questions where tinkering is not a possible or useful approach?

- what is the critical impact your tinkering exercise could have? (on you, your design/engineering practice or problem, both positive and negative)
    
- what is the impact your session have regarding (more) stuff, ecological footprint and impact on our planet (i.e. how can you avoid that STEM workshops with waste material result in more waste material?) %%

# Q1: Tinkering is a way to generate knowledge. What kind of knowledge results from a tinkering process in your experience?
New ideas! Tinkering is about trying out ideas, seeing why they do or don't work and then coming up with new and better ideas. It's also a great way to learn new skills, for the group project I wanted to learn how a processor works so I made the unrealistic goal of trying to make a processor in vhdl. I haven't actually finished it, but I now know how vhdl works, and how a simple processor works. Just because I was tinkering with it. I even made my own processor design. (fun thing is that I actually had to learn vhdl for a course, but i couldn't for the life of me get myself to watch a 2h tutorial video they gave us.)

# Q2: Tinkering with classical materials like clay, paper, colour, textiles, is more related to craft. How does tinkering work with digital and electronic media?
Really well in my opinion. Digital/Electronic media has some great properties for tinkering. It is idiot-proof, inexpensive and mistakes have no consequences among other things. It is not as hands on though which is a downside.
# Q3: One basic characteristic of science is reproducibility. Is that possible with tinkering? Or do we want that at all?
Reproducibility is definitely possible with tinkering, at sites like instructibles there are projects that other have made and you can recreate them. But i don't think it is very important for tinkering. Documenting everything in detail is nice but it takes away from the actual time tinkering. I'm not saying you shouldn't document things at all, i'm just saying that you should keep it simple and it doesn't have to be reproducible. If you finally found something cool that works you can start with actually correctly documenting everything and making it reproducible if you want.

# Q4: Design practice changed during the past years, from long design phases to short, iterative processes, due to the availability of new prototyping technologies. Is this iterative process of prototyping qualitatively different from the cycles we do in tinkering?
No, in tinkering we also use very short iterative processes. You try something, see if it works, see why it didn't or did work, and lastly you try something new. 

# Q5: Can a co-design session be described as a tinkering session as we treat it in our course?
This depends on how the co-design session is handled. If it is handled in a tinkering sort of way, like you get some materials that are easy to work with and mess around together to get the final design than yes. But if you are just talking to them, creating something very complicated that takes long design cycles then i wouldn't call it tinkering.

# Q6: The choice of materials (seed, tools, scaffolding, facilitation) has an effect on the outcome, the knowledge and products made in a tinkering session. How can we use that in a co-design session? Can we really influence the kind of results here, and do we want that?
In a co-design session this can be used to make sure components are used that are easy to adjust/customize or compatible with other materials. So you can force them to make something extendable or modular. This does however limit the options the participants in the session have. Limitations however spark creativity so in my opinion this is a good thing. If you always work with the same materials then you would get stuck in a certain mindset.

# Q7:  In “research through design” can tinkering fill in the design part?
Yes! But be aware that tinkering is not always useful. If the thing you are designing takes long to make you will get an iterative process which is very long. So you will spend most of the time making it. So it definitely depends on what you are designing.
# Q8: Are there design questions where tinkering is not a possible or useful approach?
Just like I answered in question 7, tinkering is not useful for designs that take a long time to make, making the iterative process very long. It is also not useful when making prototypes is very expensive, because you will go through a lot of cycles which get's expensive fast.

# Q9: how to balance real-world (criticality) with the fruitful mindset of tinkering?

# Q10: what is the critical impact your tinkering exercise could have? (on you, your design/engineering practice or problem, both positive and negative)

# Session 1

## Info
Time: 4h
Will learn about:
- truth tables
- the universal gates
- full adder / half adder
- Multiplexer, Demultiplexer
- Encoder, Decoder
- Karnaugh diagrams?

## Part 1
### Info
Time: 30m
Learning goals:
- universal gates
- truth tables

### Instructions
We will give each group some gates (show the gates physically or on a screen). Each gate has inputs on the left, and outputs on the right. We will also give you switches which are the inputs and some LED that are used as outputs. Go figure out with your group what each gate does.

### Components
Each group receives
- and gate
- or gate
- xor gate
- not gate
- 2 input switches
- 1 output led
- 4 empty truth table cards


## Part 2

### Info
Time: 30m
learning goals:
- Full adder/half adder

### Instructions
Give a very small explanation of all the gates (quick because everyone should know what they do by now) also mention NAND, NOR and NXOR which you can make by putting a not on the output. Explain the concept of full and half adders, what a carry is in this case. Each group is instructed to make an half adder (if they are done early they can try making a full adder).

### Components
- 2 XOR gates
- 2 AND gates
- 2 NOT gates
- 2 OR gate
- More can be grabbed from a table if needed. (this should be more than enough but you could design the same circuit in different ways.)
- 3 input switches
- 2 output LEDs
- half adder and full adder truth table cards


## Part 3
Time: 2h
learning goals:
- multiplexer/demultiplexer
- encoder/decoder
- karnaugh diagrams

### Instructions
Explain the concepts of multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders. Give the truth table cards of each component.

(Explain karnaugh diagrams and give them the premade karnaugh diagram cards)
(give each group premade designs of these components but don't tell which one is which, let them figure it out by building them.)

### Components
- karnaugh diagram cards
- Truth table cards of the multiplexer, demultiplexer, encoder and decoder.
- 5 XOR gates
- 8 AND gates
- 5 OR gates
- 5 NOT gates
- 1 Decoder block
- more gates may be grabbed from the table.

# Session 2

## Info
Time: 4h
Learning goals:
- flip flops
- state machines

## Part 1

### Info
Time: 30m
Learning goals:
- flip flops

### Instructions
Give every group the different kinds of flip flops and have them figure out what each one does. Also explain what clk does. let them pulse it themselves with an input button.

### Components
- JK flip flop block
- SR flip flip block
- T flip flop block
- D flip flop block
- 2 input switch blocks
- 1 input button block
- 1 output LED block

## Part 2

### Info
Time: 1h
Learning Goals:
- state machines

### Instructions
Explain state machines and how would design one with karnaugh diagrams. Show the basic structure of one (basically a diagram where the outputs of the flip flops is the input of the computational logic of each D flip flop) Ask them to make a simple 2 bit counter that goes like 00 01 10 11 00 etc...

### Components
- 2 D flip flops blocks
- Karnaugh diagram cards
- 5 AND blocks
- 5 OR blocks
- 5 NOT blocks
- 5 XOR blocks
- 2 Output LED blocks
- 2 Input button (one for reset/clear, other for clk) blocks

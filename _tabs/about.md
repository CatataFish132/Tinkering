My name is Thimo, I finished my study Sensor Technology at the Hanze, and am now doing the Electrical Engineering master at the Technological University of Twente.
For my bachelor assigment I had to automate an inspection with machine learning, I learned a lot in that project and found out that the mix of Electronics and Programming is where my interests lies.
At my previous study I made a lot of projects which includes making a board game with electronic ink, [making a game that enhances the motor skills in childeren](https://www.hanze.nl/en/programmes/full-time/bachelor/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-sensor-technology/projects-with-impact/project-story-olena-chashchina-and-tim-heubnen), making a stress sensor and automating a hydrophonics system for growing lettuce.
In my free time I watch movies/series, listen to music, and I am trying my best to draw/write.
